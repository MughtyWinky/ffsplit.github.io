- New:

- FFsplit now supports Virtual Camera Output. Now works as a filter in other programs.
- Added RGB32 pixel format support for FFsource DirectShow filter.
- Added Upload to Pastebin integration for reporting debug logs (you still need to send the paste url for developers).
- Added text layer cropping (hold alt while resizing layers from sides).
- Added first version of the Canvas Switcher. Please tell us which features you would like to see.
- Added more menus: Session, Canvas, Layer, Canvas Switcher
- Added following shortcut keys for Canvas and Layer list editing: Delete, Insert, Home, End
- Added proper error messages when failing to start the stream!
- Added new Hashd.tv server "EU: Frankfurt, Germany".
- Added detection for Windows 8.1

- Changes:

- Shortened the logs for better readability.
- Reworked major disconnect detection. FFsplit will now keep your connection alive no matter what.
- Improved handling of invalid characters in channel name and stream key text boxes.
- Improved Window capturing detection (unforunately this change requires adding the layers again to canvases).
- Separated Twitch.tv and Justin.tv services (previous services are converted to Twitch.tv services, Justin.tv users need to create the service again).
- Last selected canvas is now remembered across the sessions.
- Selecting encoder preset in Session tab also selects the same preset on Encoder tab for easier editing.
- Viewport options ("Enable Preview" and "Snap to Edges") are now saved properly.
- Disabling preview now hides the viewport completely (no more grey boxes).
